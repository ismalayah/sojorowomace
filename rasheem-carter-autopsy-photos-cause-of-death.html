The families of Carter think he was murdered brutally in cold blood.&nbsp;</p>Crump, the attorney, said Carter’s autopsy proved his head was separated from his body, and some of his body parts were located elsewhere. &nbsp; The civil rights attorney Ben Crump and the mother of late Crter revealed the photos of Carter from an independent autopsy where we can clearly see Rasheem’s head was separated from the rest of his body. &nbsp; Crump said the photos of the Rasheem Carter autopsy photos tell you there is nothing usual about this. He also said the family needs the highest enforcement levels to provide Rasheem Carter justice.<h2>rasheem carter age and case details revealed</h2><p>Carter was born in October 1996 and was raised in Fayette, Mississippi.
