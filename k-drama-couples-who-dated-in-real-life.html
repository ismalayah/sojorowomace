Nowadays, Korean TV shows and movies have a chance to shine, as American audiences finally open up to and recognize the quality of international media, despite the easily overcome language barrier. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parasite</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Train to Busan</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Squid Game</a> are excellent examples of the best South Korea has to offer the entertainment industry, perfectly mixing themes of horror and classism with gut-wrenching drama scenes. Even so, these types of movies and shows are not the most easily found on South Korean screens. Rather, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>K-dramas</strong></a> are.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>A devastating majority of Korean dramas have love as a central theme, making <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">romance shows</a><strong> </strong>the most popular genre in the country. These series typically feature two main characters with tragic backstories who fall in love despite all the forces against them. In fairness, some K-dramas have a lighter approach, infusing the story with moments of comic relief, but the drama component is always present. It wouldn’t be considered a K-drama otherwise.</p><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>No matter how experienced K-drama actors might be, when one is playing scenes deliberately created to sweep viewers off their feet, it’s normal to get caught up in the moment. Sometimes, though, portraying an all-encompassing romance can lead to more. We’ve all heard stories about actors who take their on-screen relationships to the real world, and it’s always an exciting experience for dedicated fans. Therefore, in a celebration of love, here we list 10 K-drama couples who made things official in real life, too.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Lee Sung Kyung and Nam Joo Hyuk</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>Any K-drama fan is familiar with this couple.
