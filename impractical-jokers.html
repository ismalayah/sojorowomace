The show is undeniably funny and has a top rating, making fans wonder if it is staged. According to the comedians, every prank is 100% real.</p><p>The show works because they are natural reactions to strangers who do not know they are on camera. While the pranks remain authentic, <a href=#>producers sometimes intervene</a> if an eager fan poses a threat to the scene.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges to ensuring that everything is authentic is that people recognize them due to their fame. They perform in New York, a city with over 8 million people. Therefore, the jokers shuffle them along, reset, and find someone else when someone recognizes them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7rEsKquqJSWwaa%2FjZympmeZor2zrcKtoJyZnGK3sLfEq6po</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kylie-mcdevitt-jason-kelce-wife-wikipedia.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kylie McDevitt Jason Kelce Wife Age, Height, Wikipedia, Instagram</a>
