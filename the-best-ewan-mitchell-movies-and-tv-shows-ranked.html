He’s extremely private, up to the point that even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his date of birth is a mystery</a>. One thing’s for certain, though, and that’s that the rising star is a phenomenal actor. House of the Dragon wrapped up its first season a few weeks ago, leaving fans with multiple new characters to love and hate, as is common with the Game of Thrones franchise. The prequel show featured an ensemble cast of both small and big names, with many actors gaining mainstream recognition due to their part in the show.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>The frequent time skips in the show introduced us to Mitchell as the adult Aemond Targaryen in the eighth episode. Aemond was a stand-out character to many viewers as a person that we all loved to hate, mostly thanks to Mitchell’s amazing performance. Since the show wrapped up, fans have wondered what else Mitchell starred in before being cast for House of the Dragon.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>So, here are Ewan Mitchell’s best movies and television shows ranked from his brief appearances, to his most acclaimed performances.</p><h2 id=h-10-doctors data-injectable=false>10.
