It is a sprinkle store that helps individuals with event decorations and sells a variety of desserts.</p><p class=dh>Osbourne and Stelly married in Hawai in 2012 after they began dating in 2011 but eventually went their separate ways in 2017. A little while before they exchanged vows, they had Pearl, after which, while wed, Stelly <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/jack-osbournes-kids-see-his-3-children-with-ex-wife-lisa-stelly/>suffered a miscarriage</a> in her second trimester.</p><p class=dh>Following this, they had Andy in 2015.

However, while they may not have worked out, the two have pushed to maintain a healthy relationship with their kids as healthy co-parents.</p><p class=dh>Their firstborn Pearl is now around ten years old, has a feisty personality, and loves scary films, while the 7-year-old Andy is described as unique. Osbourne has spoken about her unusual behavior, relaying that she believed diapers were fire at one point and wouldn't wear her clothes.</p><p class=dh>Not much seems to be known about 4-year-old Minnie except that she has been on tour with her dad so he could film and had to go into quarantine at a young age.

Osbourne stated that she sipped a glass of water that one of the staff, who had the virus, was drinking out. Osbourne said this individual didn't tell him he had contracted Coronavirus.</p><p class=dh>At the time, the dad reported that his little girl only showed mild symptoms such as a fever and a runny nose for three consecutive days. On top of this, her condition seemed to be improving.</p><p class=dh>Osbourne's mother pointed out that her granddaughter falling sick from COVID-19 shows that children are not necessarily safe from the virus.
